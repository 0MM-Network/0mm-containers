# HashiCorp Vault for Dummies: Transit Auto-Unseal Across 2 WSL Nodes

by [CloudDude](https://cloudthrill.ca/author/clouddude)

## Intro

This is part two of our **Vault for Dummies** series. After setting up a Vault server with Raft and TLS in [part1](https://cloudthrill.ca/hashicorp-vault-for-dummies-setup-your-1st-vault-with-tls-wsl), well now configure it to **auto-unseal at startup using another Vault server** as a Transit engine. Perfect if you want to simulate a cluster across nodes in WSL. This guide walks you through everything step by step so your Vault can start with full access to secrets engineswith no manual unseal required.

##  **Vault Seal/Unseal  Quick Refresher**

When Vault starts, it is in a **sealed state**, meaning it can access its storage backend but **cannot decrypt** any secrets yet.

*   **Vault data**  encrypted with an **encryption key** in the[storage backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/internals/architecture)
*   **Encryption key**  decrypted using the **master (root) key**
*   **Root key**  unlocked with **unseal key(s)**  You must unseal Vault to fully operate it.

 **Unsealing**: Is the process of providing the necessary keys to **unlock the root key**, needed by Vault to decrypt its internal encryption key (keyring). There are three options: **Manual unseal, Cloud & Transit Auto-Unseal**.

###   **Why Transit Auto Unseal?**

Sealing- state provides security, but manual unsealing adds overhead on your ops team. Imagine having to unseal 100 servers after each maintenance/reboot and wake all your key holders in the middle of the night . **Transit Auto Unseal** cuts that pain by letting a trusted cluster handle root key decryption at startup**no human needed**.

##  WSL1 Assumptions

*   We will add a **second custom static IP** using ******PowerShell****** to allow for **two Vault nodes** in a single machine.
*   **WSL1** doesnt support **`systemd`**, so a boot-**startup script** must be invoked via the `**wsl.conf**` .

## Lab Configuration

This setup covers the Vault Associate exam basicscheck the [Part1 tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration) for the full configuration.

# I. Getting Started

## 1 Install Vault (both instances)

  Download & Install Vault Binary (Linux)

```
wget -O vault.zip https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/1.18.3/vault_1.18.3_linux_amd64.zip
unzip vault*.zip && rm -f vault*.zip
chmod +x vault
sudo mv vault /usr/bin/vault

###  Check Installation
$ vault --version
  Vault v1.18.3
```

 Enable Autocomplete

```
vault -autocomplete-install
complete -C /usr/bin/vault vault
```

  
  Create Vault User

```
sudo groupadd --system vault
sudo useradd --system --home /srv/vault --shell /bin/false --gid vault vault
```

## 2 Set a new Static IP for Vault 1 (WSL instance)

To run multiple Vault instances in WSL, youll need to assign static IPs into a **loopback interface** using PowerShell.

*   [** Install Loopback Adapter**](#tab-stronginstallloopbackadapterstrong)
*   [**Assign Static IP (PowerShell)**](#tab-strongassignstaticippowershellstrong)

To give WSL1 a dedicated local static IP without affecting your main network connection:

*   **Install Loopback Adapter:**
    *   Open**Device Manager**( Win+X -> Device Manager).
    *   Click computer name, then Action >**Add legacy hardware**.
    *   Next > Install the hardware that I manually select > Next.
    *   Select**Network adapters**> Next.
    *   Manufacturer:**Microsoft**, Model:**Microsoft KM-TEST Loopback Adapter**> Next > Next > Finish.

**Assign new Static IP (192.168.57.1) to the host machine:**

*   **Find its name** (e.g., Ethernet 4):

```
Get-NetAdapter | Where InterfaceDescription -eq "Microsoft KM-TEST Loopback Adapter"
Name          InterfaceDescription               ifIndex Status  MacAddress             
----------    ---------------------------------  ------ -------- --------------
Ethernet 4    Microsoft KM-TEST Loopback Adapter    57     Up    2-10-8C-3F-1F-*        
```

*   **Add IP as Admin**:(Use your chosen IP/Name).

```
New-NetIPAddress -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet 4" -IPAddress "192.168.57.1" -PrefixLength 24

IPAddress         : 192.168.57.1   <----- Our unique IP for Vault1 instance
InterfaceIndex    : 57
InterfaceAlias    : Ethernet 4
AddressFamily     : IPv4
Type              : Unicast
PrefixLength      : 24
...
```

*   **Test the IP connectivity** from a WSL instance (vault1 can now bind to192.168.57.1.)

```
$ ping 192.168.58.1 -c 1
PING 192.168.58.1 (192.168.58.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.58.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=128 time=0.281 ms 
```

## 3 Configure Vault TLS (with Raft)

Same as in the [Part1 tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration). You need to set the IPs accordingly for each vault instances (For Testing Only).

*   [**Generate Certificates** Vault1](#tab-stronggeneratecertificatesstrongvault1)
*   [**Generate Certificates** Vault2](#tab-stronggeneratecertificatesstrongvault2)
*   [**Add Certs to Trusted Store**](#tab-strongaddcertstotrustedstorestrong)

  Create TLS Directory

```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/vault/tls
```

  Add Opnssl conf file

```
$ vi vault-openssl1.cnf
[req]
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions = v3_req
prompt = no

[req_distinguished_name]
C = US
ST = State
L = City
O = Organization
OU = Unit
CN = 192.168.57.1 # Primary IP (vault1)

[v3_req]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
IP.1 = 127.0.0.1
IP.2 = 192.168.57.1
```

 Create the **Self-Signed** certificate pair

```
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout /opt/vault/tls/vault-key.pem \
  -out /opt/vault/tls/vault-cert.pem \
  -config vault-openssl1.cnf
```

  **Set Permissions**

```
sudo chown -R vault:vault /opt/vault/
sudo chmod 640 /opt/vault/tls/vault-key.pem
sudo chmod 644 /opt/vault/tls/vault-cert.pem
```

**Note:** In production, **`root:root`** ownership is more secure, with Vault user only having read access.

  Create TLS Directory

```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/vault/tls
```

  Add Opnssl conf file

```
$ vi vault-openssl2.cnf
[req]
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions = v3_req
prompt = no

[req_distinguished_name]
C = US
ST = State
L = City
O = Organization
OU = Unit
CN = 192.168.56.1  # Primary IP (vault2) 

[v3_req]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
IP.1 = 127.0.0.1
IP.2 = 192.168.56.1
```

  
 Create the **Self-Signed** certificate pair

```
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout /opt/vault/tls/vault-key.pem \
  -out /opt/vault/tls/vault-cert.pem \
  -config vault-openssl2.cnf
```

  **Set Permissions**

```
sudo chown -R vault:vault /opt/vault/
sudo chmod 640 /opt/vault/tls/vault-key.pem
sudo chmod 644 /opt/vault/tls/vault-cert.pem
```

**Note:** In production, **`root:root`** ownership is more secure, with Vault user only having read access.

Add Certificate to the Trusted Store (both servers)

```
sudo cp /opt/vault/tls/vault-cert.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/vault-cert.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

## 4 Configuration transit Vault1 (TLS + Raft)

If youre on Systemd friendly WSL, please refer to [Part1 tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration) for Vault service creation. Ill use a `wsl.conf` trick here.

*   [**Create** **Vault2** **Configuration**](#tab-strongcreatestrongstrongvault2strongstrongconfigurationstrong)
*   [  **Initialize** & **Unseal Vault2**](#tab-stronginitializestrongampstrongunsealvault2strong)
*   [**Create the Vault Startup Script**](#tab-strongcreatethevaultstartupscriptstrong)

  Create transit vault server Configuration file

```
### 1. Create Config Directory
sudo mkdir -p /etc/vault.d

### 2. Create the hcl config file
vi /etc/vault.d/vault.hcl
# Full configuration options can be found 
# Here https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration

storage "raft" {
  path    = "/opt/vault/data"
  node_id = "node2"
}
# Cluster
cluster_addr  = "https://192.168.56.1:8201"
api_addr      = "https://192.168.56.1:8200"

# HTTPS listener
listener "tcp" {
  address     = "192.168.56.1:8200"
  cluster_address = "192.168.56.1:8201"
  tls_cert_file = "/opt/vault/tls/vault-cert.pem"
  tls_key_file  = "/opt/vault/tls/vault-key.pem"
}

#Other
ui            = true
disable_mlock = true
```

  
 Validate & Set Permissions

```
vault operator diagnose -config=/etc/vault.d/vault.hcl
sudo chown -R vault:vault /etc/vault.d
sudo chmod 640 /etc/vault.d/vault.hcl
```

  Set Vault Environment Variable

```
export VAULT_ADDR='https://192.168.56.1:8200'
echo "export VAULT_ADDR='https://192.168.56.1:8200'" >> ~/.bashrc

#   Check Vault Status
vault status
### check via API
curl -k https://192.168.56.1:8200/v1/sys/seal-status
```

1\. Initialize vault cluster

```
vault operator init -key-shares=3 -key-threshold=2 > key.txt
### output 
Unseal Key 1: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Unseal Key 2: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Unseal Key 3: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Initial Root Token: hvs.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Note:**   Store your key.txt file securely. Without enough unseal keys, youll lose access to your Vault.

2\. Use 2 keys at least to unseal **Vault2**:

```
vault operator unseal
# Enter at least 2 of the 3 unseal keys
Unseal Key (will be hidden): **************************
Key             Value
---             -----
Seal Type       shamir
Initialized     true
Sealed          false
Total Shares    3
Threshold       2
Unseal Progress 0/2
Unseal Nonce    n/a
Version         1.15.0
Storage Type    file
Cluster Name    vault-cluster-1234
Cluster ID      01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef
HA Enabled      false
```

1.  **Create** and add permissions to the file `start_services.sh`

```
$ vi ~/.config/vault/start_service.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Replace this with your WSL node's static IP (e.g. 192.168.56.1)
export VAULT_ADDR='https://192.168.56.1:8200'  ##  Vault2

# Start Vault as a background process
vault server -config=/etc/vault.d/vault.hcl >> /var/log/vault.log 2>&1 &

$ chmod +x ~/.config/vault/start_services.sh
```

2\. **Configure `wsl.conf` to Run the Script on Launch**

```
$ vi /etc/wsl.conf 
[boot]
command="sudo bash /home/<your_user>/.config/vault/start_service.sh"

[user]
default=<your_username>
[network]
hostname = <Your_WSLhostname>
```

## 5 Transit encryption Setup in Vault 2

#### 1\. **Enable the Transit Secrets Engine** on Vault 2 (your trusted cluster):

```
vault secrets enable transit
```

#### 2\. **Create the encryption key** for unsealing:

```
vault write -f transit/keys/autounseal
```

#### 3\. **Create** and apply the `auto-unseal-policy` that allows encrypt/decrypt operations on the autounseal key

```
vault policy write auto-unseal-policy - <<EOF
path "transit/keys/autounseal" {
  capabilities = ["update", "create", "read"]
}
path "transit/encrypt/autounseal" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}
path "transit/decrypt/autounseal" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}
EOF
```

#### Generate a Plain, Renewable Token (No Wrapping):

This token has the right permissions and is the one Vault 1 will use in its seal transit stanza.  

```
vault token create -orphan -period=24h -policy=auto-unseal-policy
Key                  Value
---                  -----
token                hvs.CAESICTtxxx
token_accessor       vhr3t7vGlEtAFbJe8P7RHAF0
token_duration       24h
token_renewable      true
token_policies       ["auto-unseal-policy" "default"]  
```

**Note:** Even if Token Wrapping adds security, **Vault 1** must be authenticated to unwrap, which isnt possible when sealed.

## 6  Use Transit to Auto-Unseal Vault 1

In the `configuration file`, use the token **directly** (i.e `config-autounseal.hcl`)

```
$ vi  /etc/vault.d/config-autounseal.hcl

storage "raft" {
  path    = "/opt/vault/data"
  node_id = "node1"
}

cluster_addr  = "https://192.168.57.1:8301"
api_addr      = "https://192.168.57.1:8300"
ui = true
disable_mlock = true
# HTTPS listener
listener "tcp" {
  address     = "192.168.57.1:8300"
  cluster_address = "0.0.0.0:8301"
  tls_cert_file = "/opt/vault/tls/vault-cert.pem"
  tls_key_file  = "/opt/vault/tls/vault-key.pem"
}

ui = true

#mlock = true
disable_mlock = true

seal "transit" {    #    seal "transit" stanza. 
  address         = "https://192.168.56.1:8200"
  key_name        = "autounseal"
  mount_path      = "transit/"
  disable_renewal = "false"
  token           = "hvs.CAESICTtxxx" #  Token from Transit Vault2 
```

###  **Start and initialize** **Vault 2**:

```
vault server -config=config-autounseal.hcl
```

Open another terminal and initialize your second Vault server (**Vault 2**). Save the token for later use.

```
$ VAULT_ADDR=http://192.168.57.1:8300 vault operator init
Recovery Key 1: BOEVB5Q0/xxx
Recovery Key 2: gE9BhsJSBxxx
Recovery Key 3: WoUxp1F3xxxx
Recovery Key 4: Xj55tUDrxxxx
Recovery Key 5: Yn1kOKxxxxxx

Initial Root Token: hvs.k8Z4E47GExxxx

Success! Vault is initialized (unseal transit configuration from node ubuntu22) june 5 7:53AM

Recovery key initialized with 5 key shares and a key threshold of 3. Please
securely distribute the key shares printed above.
```

Check the Vault 2 server status. It is now successfully initialized and unsealed.

```
$ VAULT_ADDR=http://192.168.57.1:8300 vault status
Key                      Value
---                      -----
Recovery Seal Type       shamir
Initialized              true
Sealed                   false    <---    Auto-Unsealed
Total Recovery Shares    5
Threshold                3
```

# II. Vault1 Auto-Startup in WSL

Finally to auto-start Vault on WSL boot, use a startup script + `wsl.conf`:

```
# vi  ~/.config/vault/start_service.sh
#!/bin/bash
nohup vault server -config=/etc/vault.d/config-autounseal.hcl >> /var/log/vault.log 2>&1 &
```

**wsl.conf**

```
# vi /etc/wsl.conf
[boot]
systemd=true
command="sudo /home/<your_user>/.config/vault/start_service.sh"

[user]
default=<your_username>
[network]
hostname = <Your_WSLhostname>
```

## Login to the Vault UI

Once Vault is auto-unsealed, you can log in to the UI at its URL [https://192.168.57.1:8300](https://192.168.57.1:8300/) using your saved root token.

**** Even with auto-unseal enabled, the related Transit Vault still needs manual unsealing after a each reboot.

#  Conclusion

And thats a wrap on setting up a 2-node Vault transit auto-unseal, static IPs, and a solid WSL dev environment! It took some digging (and a few stubborn IP conflicts), but now youve got a local setup that mirrors real-world scenarios. Perfect for deeper Vault practice or Vault exam prep.
